#Markit On Demand - Data APIs

_Play with some real market data, have fun and show off. Send us your creation._

We have a few APIs for you to play around with, and we’re working to add some more. Details on how to use the Lookup API, Snap Quote API and the Timeseries API for a historical pricing dataset [can be found here](http://jobs.markitondemand.com/APIs). We have a full set of documentation available, too, so put on a pot of coffee and enjoy. 

##Usage

This repository contains a couple usage examples to get you started, but you should visit [jobs.markitondemand.com](http://jobs.markitondemand.com/APIs) for full details and docs.
